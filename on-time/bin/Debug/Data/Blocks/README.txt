hey so on-time works entirely with mods;
that's right, no built in stuff except for generation types.

here's how to add blocks:
BlockName:#(Character):15(ForegroundColor):0(BackgroundColor):stone(Gentype):100(Gen data, 100% likely over other stone):yes(is visible/enable rendering)

gentypes:
air (only one block can use this)
stone (the base of the world)
grass (the very top layer of soil)
dirt (under grass between stone)

it's a given that there has to be at least one of each of these
